# Solutioninn_scraper
This repository contains a PHP script designed to retrieve content from a specified URL, particularly targeting `solutioninn.com`, utilizing cURL for HTTP requests. The script includes functionality to handle cookies and maintain session state across requests.

## Getting Started

To use this script, you'll need:
- A web server with PHP support.
- Basic understanding of PHP and cURL.

### Installation

git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
```

2. Place the PHP script (`script.php`) in your web server's document root or desired directory.

3. Ensure that the directory has appropriate permissions to read and write files, as the script will create and delete a cookie file (`cookies.txt`) to manage session state.

## Usage

1. Ensure your web server is running and accessible.
2. Access the PHP script via a web browser, passing the URL you wish to retrieve content from as a GET parameter. For example:
   ```
   http://your_domain/script.php?url=https://www.solutioninn.com/
